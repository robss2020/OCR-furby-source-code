# OCR of Furby source code

## Motivation
The Furby 1998 source code is available here in PDF format:
https://archive.org/details/furby-source

For ease of reading and accessibility I wanted to OCR it.  The result is a very rough OCR version suitable for reading many of the comments, but not the code.

## Method

* I downloaded the PDF book from https://archive.org/details/furby-source
* I ran the PDF file through Optical Character Recognition in English.
* I did not manually verify or modify the output.

## Limitations - AS-IS

This is a rough OCR without any manual revisions. You might find it useful to skim through some of the comments, but
the unindented code and many OCR mistakes make this far from a faithful full reproduction.
